void loop()
{
  If all the data needed has been collected using your interrupt handler then
    calculate the period of the incoming signal using Timer0's frequency and the number of Timer0 counts that have happen during one period of the incoming signal 
    calculate the incoming signals frequency and print it. (put in a delay so you can easily read Serial Monitor)
    reset edge_counter to zero. (Use edge_counter to determine if you want to start collecting data, end collecting data, or have already collected all the data you need)
}

void NAME YOUR HANDLER ROUTINE HERE
{
  If we want to start collecting data (check edge_counter) set Timer0 register, TCNT0, to zero. This allows the most counts to occur before a roll over occurs
  If the value of edge_counter tells you one period of the incoming signal has elapsed then record the number of Timer0 counts (register, TCNT0)
  At each interrup increase edge_counter, which counts how many rising edges have occurred. (remember edge_counter will continue to increase even after one period has been counted)
